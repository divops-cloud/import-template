## ðŸ”½ Installation

`import` is a single, self-contained shell script. Installation is as simple
as downloading the script into your `$PATH` and giving it executable permissions.

For example, to install `import` to `/usr/local/bin`, run the following:

```bash
curl -sfLS https://import.pw > /usr/local/bin/import
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/import
```


## ðŸ‘¢ Bootstrapping the `import` function

Once you have the `import` script installed, there are two preferred ways to
utilize it in your shell scripts: _shebang_ or _source_.


#### Shebang

The most straightforward way to specify `import` as the entry point of the script
using the "shebang" feature of executable files:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env import

type import
```

Note that this method will use the interpreter located at `/bin/sh`, which usually
implies baseline POSIX features. If you need more control over which interpreter
is used then see the next method.

#### Source

Another way to bootstrap `import` is to simply source it into your script.
This method gives you control over which interpreter is used. For example,
if you need bash-specific features, you can specify to use it in the shebang,
and then source the `import` script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

. "$(which import)"

type import
```

#### Eval

Finally, for scenarios when `import` _is not installed_, it is possible to
`curl` + `eval` the import function directly into your shell script.

```bash
#!/bin/sh

eval "$(curl -sfLS https://import.pw)"

type import
```

Note that this method is not as ideal as the shebang/sourcing methods, because
this version incurs an HTTP request to retrieve the import function every time
the script is run, and it won't work offline.
